## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🪟 Recursive Infinite Window Partitioner

An interactive **recursive layout builder** built with **React + TypeScript**.  
You can split tiles **horizontally** or **vertically**, and each tile keeps its own persistent color.  
Tiles can also be **deleted** dynamically, and the layout tree automatically updates and cleans itself.

- ↔️ **Horizontal or vertical splits** — choose how to divide your layout.
- ❌ **Smart cleanup** — when tiles are deleted, the parent auto-collapses if needed.
